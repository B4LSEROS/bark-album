                <Paragraphs>I recently completed my bachelors degree in CS from Fordham University, and I'm currently pursuing further studies to become a better professional. I am certainly excited about the possibility of interning Eulerity, as I shared some of the same core values that Eulerity embraces, such as Impact, gratitude, and dependability.
                </Paragraphs>

                <Paragraphs>I consider myself a responsible, proactive professional and know that I will provide a positive value to the company, which will allow me to grow both as a professional and as a person. I look forward to further discuss my qualifications, background and get to discover more about Eulerity. Thank you ðŸ˜„</Paragraphs>
